# SalesAnalysis
**Goal of the project :** The objective of this project was to create a sales analysis dashboard using Tableau, which would offer an interactive interface for in-depth examination of sales performance. The primary aim was to provide comprehensive insights into sales data, empowering data-driven decision-making and facilitating the identification of growth opportunities within the business. 

**Persona :** The persona for this project is a "Sales Analyst," a vital role within a business responsible for analyzing and interpreting sales data. Their primary function is to develop dashboards and reports using business intelligence tools, providing valuable insights into the company's sales performance. Equipped with strong skills in data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling, sales analysts excel at identifying patterns and trends in sales data. Their expertise and recommendations enable companies to optimize their sales performance by making informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

This Dashboard answers many questions such as "How does the sales performance of a particular product category vary across various geographic regions and states, as well as throughout different months of the year and is there any similarities in sales across different states of that product category?", "What is a quantity of product orders across different age groups and gender, and how does the order quantities changes for product category by gender?"

## Walkthrough
In this project, a variety of graphs and visualizations have been utilized to gain meaningful insights from the sales data. These include:

- Line graph: A line graph has been employed for time-based sales analysis, specifically focusing on monthly sales trends. This visualization helps in understanding the sales patterns and identifying any significant fluctuations over time.

- Bar graph: Bar graphs have been used to analyze quantity orders within different age groups, distinguishing between males and females. This type of visualization allows for a clear comparison of order quantities and demographic distribution, aiding in understanding customer preferences and targeting specific segments.

- Donut graph: The donut graph has been utilized to examine region-wise sales. By visualizing the distribution of sales across different regions, it becomes easier to identify the regions contributing the most to overall sales and evaluate their relative importance.

- Map: A map visualization has been employed to visualize the sales on a state level within the United States. This type of visualization provides a geographical perspective, enabling the identification of states with the highest and lowest sales volumes.

- Butterfly chart: A butterfly chart has been used to analyze the quantity of orders by gender for each product category. This visualization allows for a direct comparison of order quantities between genders within different product categories, highlighting any significant differences or similarities.

- Furthermore, clustering concepts have been applied to understand the similarity between states in terms of sales. Clustering techniques enable the grouping of states based on sales patterns and similarities, providing valuable insights into regional sales performance and potential market opportunities.

Overall, through the strategic utilization of various graph types and clustering techniques, this project aims to uncover meaningful patterns and insights from the sales data, facilitating informed decision-making and identifying areas for growth and improvement.
